# Spring Boot

Opinionated framework on top of Spring framework with default configurations for a quick backend development.

# Core Technologies

## IoC
Manage lifecycle of java objects. `ApplicationContext` represents the IoC container.

## Beans
Objects managed by the Spring framework.

## Configurations

## AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
Separating cross-cutting concerns from the business logic code for increasesd code modularity. Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple parts of the application, such as logging, security, or transaction management. These concerns can lead to code duplication and tangled code if not handled properly. This modularization helps keep the business logic clean and uncluttered by separating the additional functionalities into aspects.

# Tools

## Maven
It is a project management and build automation tool. Maven projects are configured using a Project Object Model (POM) in a `pom.xml` file. The file contains information such as dependencies, source directory, plugin, etc.

### Build lifecycles

* `clean` - Remove all files generated by the previous build
* `compile` - Turns source files into class files
* `test` - Runs unit tests
* `package` - Creates an artifact such as a JAR, ZIP or WAR file

### Default Directory Layout

* `src/main/java` - Application/Library sources
* `src/main/resources` - Application/Library resources
* `src/test/java` - Test sources
* `target` - Contains all the final products from the build

### Maven Wrapper
Utility script to run the Maven project without having Maven installed. Ensures that the correct Maven version is used, providing consistency across different development environments.

```
./mvnw clean install
```
